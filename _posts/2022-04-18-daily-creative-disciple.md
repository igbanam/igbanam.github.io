> Well first geeky thing I learned from this is that to put the `#` symbol in the metadata part of the markdown file, you have to escape it with the `&` escape code. Who would have thunk it?

I saw a tweet from [@chesoofficial](https://twitter.com/ChesoOfficial) about the [#DailyCreativeChallenge](https://twitter.com/ChesoOfficial/status/1515786868952117255), and I thought "Couldn't have come at a better time!" In a world rid with dopemine highs, I think this is the perfect challenge to reintroduce mastery in craft through discipline and consistency. I'll be [joining in](https://twitter.com/Yaasky/status/1516001361732816897) as the trifecta in my bio. ðŸ”¥

The _poet_ would be on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yaasky) with haiku versions of whatever musings are catalogued. The _person_ will summarize wisdom from the [On Being](onbeing.com) project here. The programmer will also share learnings from [Crafing Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) here.
