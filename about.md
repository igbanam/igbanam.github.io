I am a software engineer with a passion for Software Architecture, Design
Patterns, Architecural Patterns, and Software Engineering Processes.

Primarily (rather, "frequently"), I am a Ruby developer who has spent most of
his time on the Ruby on Rails framework. Other languages I am proficient in are
PHP (Yii 2). I am experimenting with Elixir (Phoenix), and Crystal (Amber) at the
