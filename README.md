### _The programmer in the Yasky tripartite_

This site is meant to catalogue my thoughts around programming and what not. The views here are totally mine, and are up for debate. Please engage profusely. You can reach me on [Twitter][1].

## Build Process

This site is built with [Jekyll][2]. Originally hosted on [Github Pages][3], at the time of writing up this README, I am in the process of moving the site to [Netlify][4]. Nothing fancy. Just a static site generator.
